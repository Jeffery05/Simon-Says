# Simon Says
Hi there! This program is intended to simulate playing virtual Simon Says. Simon Says starts off with the program flashing a series of colours in a specific pattern on the colour wheel. Then, you will have to use your keyboard to play back the exact pattern, including the correct colours in the correct order.

Before playing, you will be able to select the difficulty level and the number of colours that will be displayed. Every time you correctly playback a colour, you will earn points. You will be able to keep playing and racking up points until you flash an incorrect colour, in which case your score will be reset to 0 and you will have to start over.

There is also a leaderboard feature where the top 10 players with the highest scores get recorded. Try topping the chart!
